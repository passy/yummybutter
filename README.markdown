===========

A super simple Fragment-based Android application starting off as a
tightly-coupled mess and slowly turning into a dependency injected, losely
coupled, testable ... mess. This is the demo application of Passy's Library
Toolbox series which should turn into a blog article series at some point,
hopefully. Until then, read the commit log, Luke.
